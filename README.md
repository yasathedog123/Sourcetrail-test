## Important
This project was archived by the original authors and maintainers of Sourcetrail by the end of 2021. You can read more about this decision in this [blog entry](https://web.archive.org/web/20211115131149/https://www.sourcetrail.com/blog/discontinue_sourcetrail/).

This is a **fork** of the Sourcetrail project and I want to keep this project at least buildable.

# Building

There are 2 ways to build the project:
1. With **vcpkg** provided packages ([Vcpkg build](#vcpkg-build))
2. With the **system** provided packages ([System build](#system-build))

## Cloning

It is important to clone the repository with the **submodules** and the **symlinks**:
```
git clone https://github.com/petermost/Sourcetrail.git --recurse-submodules --config core.symlinks=true
```
and get the updates with:
```
git pull --recurse-submodules
```



## Vcpkg Build
Depending on the platform and the selected indexer, additional software/packages must be installed.
* **Java Indexer:**
    * [OpenJDK](https://jdk.java.net/)
    * [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
* **Linux:** 
    * **Qt6:** Install additional packages with `scripts/install-qt6-dependencies.sh`.
* **Windows:**
    * [Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) 
* **macOS:**
  * [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
  * libtools, autoconf, autoconf-archive, automake, patchelf, ninja

Prepare the build in a terminal or command prompt ("x64 Native Tools Command Prompt"):
```
$ cd Sourcetrail
$ cmake --preset vcpkg-ninja-release
```
Note that the initial compilation of the vcpkg packages (especially LLVM) will take a **long** time!

> [!TIP]
> Download a [binary release](#star-binary-releases).

Build:
```
$ cd ../build/vcpkg-ninja-release
$ cmake --build .
```


## System build

### Linux

To compile it under (K)ubuntu 25.04, "Plucky Puffin", install the following packages:

**General packages:** cmake, ninja-build, libboost1.88-all-dev, libboost-charconv1.88-dev, qt6-base-dev, qt6-svg-dev, libsqlite3-dev, libtinyxml-dev

**C++ packages:** clang-20, libclang-20-dev

**Java packages:** maven, openjdk-24-jdk

**Unit test packages:** catch2, libgtest-dev

Prepare the build:
```
$ cd Sourcetrail
$ cmake --preset system-ninja-release
```

Build:
```
$ cd ../build/system-ninja-release
$ cmake --build .
```

### Windows
System build is not tested and therefore not supported.

### macOS
System build is not tested and therefore not supported.
